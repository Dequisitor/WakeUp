# WakeUp

First version of a personalised wake-up alarm written in Python.
In order to make it work on your side you will need 2 api keys. For the newest version you will need one frm worldweatheronline.org for weather (obviously) and one from voicerss.org (very good quality, lots of options). Both are free, registration is quick and simple.

## Usage
I use crontab to set it as a wakeup alarm. I got a relay hooked to the rapsberry pi that is using it, so I switch on a lamp with the relay, wait a minute and then read my custom weather reporting sentences out loud. Quite handy on some mornings.
